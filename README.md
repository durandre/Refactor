# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The task was to take an existing code and refactor it to meet the following accesibility standards:

WHEN viewing the source code
THEN semantic HTML elements will be found
WHEN viewing the structure of the HTML elements
THEN the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN viewing the image elements
THEN accessible alt attributes will be found
WHEN viewing the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN viewing the title element
THEN a concise, descriptive title will be found

For this exercise I changed the <div> tags to semantic HTML elements. Then I combined elements that had the same postion and styling. Next I add alt text to the images. I moved the headings to be in sequential order and wrote descriptive titles for the elements. I did have issues with centering "Lead Generation." I struggled with screenshotting the entire page and then uploading it here. I am not understanding how to commit these changes to Github. I have scheduled 2 tutoring session with my tutor next week to go over Git more in depth. I plan on doing research this weekend as well. I was pleased with the way the refactored website came out as it is my first project with coding for this class.
