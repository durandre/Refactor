# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The task was to take an existing code and refactor it to meet the following accesibility standards:

WHEN viewing the source code
THEN semantic HTML elements will be found
WHEN viewing the structure of the HTML elements
THEN the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN viewing the image elements
THEN accessible alt attributes will be found
WHEN viewing the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN viewing the title element
THEN a concise, descriptive title will be found
